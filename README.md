# Recommendations with IBM

### Project Overview
#### This project is a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree by Udacity. This project follows a structured approach to building and evaluating recommendation systems. It uses data on user-article interactions to explore, rank, and personalize recommendations through various techniques.

### Project Structure
This project is divided into the following tasks

I. Exploratory Data Analysis

. Investigate the dataset to understand the distribution of users, articles, and interactions.
. Visualize and summarize basic statistics such as most viewed articles and unique user engagement.

II. Rank Based Recommendations

. Build simple popularity-based recommendations by identifying the most read articles.
. Suitable for cold-start scenarios (e.g., new users) where personalized data isnâ€™t available.

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

. Construct a user-item interaction matrix.
. Use dot products between user vectors to find similar users.
. Recommend articles that similar users have engaged with, but the target user has not.
. This step uses preprocessed .p files:
    . user_item_matrix.p: Full interaction matrix
    . user_item_train.p: Training split of interactions
    . user_item_test.p: Test split for evaluation


VI. Matrix Factorization (via SVD)

. Use matrix decomposition (Singular Value Decomposition) to identify latent features of users and articles.
. Predict user preferences for unseen articles based on learned latent structures (isn't very great honestly).
. Evaluate performance against the test set.
. Analyze limitations of the approach due to implicit feedback (no ratings) and data sparsity.


### Technologies Used

. Python
. Pandas, NumPy
. Pickle (for saving and loading preprocessed interaction matrices)
. Scikit-learn (for SVD implementation)
. Jupyter Notebook (for prototyping and experimentation)


### Data Files

The following .p (pickle) files are loaded to streamline data access and reduce recomputation:

. user_item_matrix.p: Full user-item interaction DataFrame.
. user_item_train.p: Subset of interactions for training.
. user_item_test.p: Subset of interactions for testing recommendations.
